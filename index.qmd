I am the Faculty Leader of the [FIRE Sustainability Analytics](https://www.fire.umd.edu/sa) research group at the University of Maryland's The First-Year Innovation & Research Experience (FIRE) Program. I am committed to creating effective approaches to teach undergraduate students how to conduct empirical microeconomics research.

 

I received my Ph.D. in [Agricultural and Applied Economics from the University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://aae.wisc.edu/) in 2018. As a researcher, I am interested in using econometrics and atmospheric science models to assess the consequences of air pollution regulations, their environmental outcomes, and their inequitable impact of different demographic groups.
