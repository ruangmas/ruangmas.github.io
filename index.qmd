I am the Faculty Leader of the [FIRE Sustainability Analytics](https://www.fire.umd.edu/sa) research group at the University of Maryland. I am dedicated to training undergraduate students in empirical microeconomics and data science. Under my mentorship, students conduct end-to-end research; from data query, exploration, wrangling, modeling, and presentation.

I received my Ph.D.Â in [Agricultural and Applied Economics from the University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://aae.wisc.edu/) in 2018. As a researcher, I am interested in using economics and atmospheric science models to assess the consequences of air pollution regulations.
