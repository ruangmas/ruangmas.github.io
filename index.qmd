My name is Thanicha (pronounced Ta-nee-sha) Ruangmas.

I am the Faculty Leader of the [FIRE Sustainability Analytics](https://www.fire.umd.edu/sa) research group at the University of Maryland. I am dedicated to training undergraduate students in empirical microeconomics and data science. Under my mentorship, students learn to conduct end-to-end research; from data query, exploration, wrangling, modeling, and presentation. Students' work are showcased on [this website.](https://umdfiresa.github.io/)

I received my Ph.D.Â in [Agricultural and Applied Economics from the University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://aae.wisc.edu/) in 2018. As a researcher, I am interested in using economics and atmospheric science models to assess the consequences of air pollution regulations.
